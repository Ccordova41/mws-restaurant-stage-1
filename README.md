# Readme Restaurant Reviews  

## Description

Welcome to the best and only Restaurant review site you'll need. ðŸ˜‰
You can view the restaurants that are located in your area and all of the information needed.

PLUS, view the reviews for these establishments so you can decide if this is the restaurant you'll be going to.

## Getting Started

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With the server running, visit `http://localhost:8000`


Let's get started!!!
